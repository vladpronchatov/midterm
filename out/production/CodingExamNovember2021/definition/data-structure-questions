Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
A.Data structures are needed to design efficient algorithms to maximize productivity.

What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
Create, Read, Update, Delete in primitive data structures.
Insertion, Deletion, Searching, Traversal, Sorting, Merging in non-primitive structures.

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
graphics, database management, statistical analysis, numerical analysis, operating system, simulation, compiler design

what is an Array?
array is a container object which stores multiple values in a single variable.

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
array is a fixed length data structure while ArrayList is a variable length Collection class which can be changed.

what is LinkedList?
an ordered collection of multiple objects of the same type which are stored in containers called nodes
and linked to the next node using pointers.

How is an Array different from Linked List?
array is fixed in length while LinkedList is not, LinkedList uses more memory in order to link nodes to the next node.

what is queue?
queue is an interface which is an ordered list of objects to be processed in FIFO order.

what is stack?
stack is used to store the collection of objects in LIFO order.

what is FIFO and LIFO?
FIFO is first in, first out. LIFO is last in, first out. This describes the order in which objects are processed during
collection.

what is the order of complexity?
how complex the algorithm is depends on the size of it and the time required to run it. The more complex, the longer
it takes to run.

what is the best case to search an element from an array?
Sequential search is the most effective way of finding an element in an array as it can be at the start of the array.

what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
sequential search is also the least effective way to find an element as it may be at the end of the array.

what is tree in data structure?
tree is a non-linear collection of nodes which are organized in hierarchical relationship. all nodes are linked
to the top of the tree structure, which is called the root node.

what is graph in data structure?
graph is a non-linear structure of nodes organized using edges and vertices.

what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
HashMap is non-synchronized, allows one null key and multiple null values.
HashTable is synchronized, doesn't allow any null keys or null values.

What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
Array in RDBMS, Queue in Network, Tree in Hierarchical.

How HashMap works in java?
it can store objects and retrieve it in constant time using hashing principles, storing using put method and retrieving
using get method.

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
it is a runtime exception that indicates that we are trying to access an array element with an illegal index, when
the index is negative or greater than or equal to the size of the array.

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
cloning, using System.arraycopy() method, using variable assignment, copy by iterating

What is difference between an array and a linked list?
array is fixed in length while LinkedList is not, LinkedList uses more memory in order to link nodes to the next node.

What is DFS and BFS?
DFS is Depth First Search uses Stack and traverses from the root node to the farthest node.
BFS is Breadth First Search finds the shortest path in a Queue data structure.

What is Recursion?
the process of having a method call itself continuously.

What are linear and non linear data Structures?
linear structures have elements that are arranged in a sequential manner and linked together.
non-linear structures are not in a single level and cannot be traversed in one path.

What is Big-(O)-notation?
describes how long an algorithm takes to run to measure efficiency.

Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
Bubble sort is O(n^2).
Insertion sort is O(n^2).
Selection sort is O(n^2).
Heap sort is O(NLog).
Quick sort is O(NLog).
Merge sort is O(NLog).
Shell sort is O((nlog(n))^2).
